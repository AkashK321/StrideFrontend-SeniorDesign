# ============================================================================
# WORKFLOW: Infrastructure Deploy
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Deploys all AWS infrastructure including the CloudFormation stack,
#   Lambda function (using the JAR from backend-build), API Gateway, and
#   any other AWS resources. This is the single deployment workflow that
#   handles everything in AWS.
#
# TRIGGERS:
#   1. Called by backend-build (workflow_call):
#      - Primary trigger: Only after successful build and unit tests
#      - Inputs: branch_name, jar_artifact_id
#      - Downloads JAR artifact and deploys everything
#   2. Push event when CDK code changes (if backend already built):
#      - Paths: aws_resources/cdk/**
#      - Branches: All branches (**)
#      - Note: Will need to download latest JAR artifact or use existing
#   3. Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch):
#      - Can be run manually with branch_name input
#      - Use with caution: bypasses build/test gates
#
# WORKFLOW FLOW:
#   workflow_call (from backend-build) OR push (cdk/**) OR workflow_dispatch
#       ↓
#   infrastructure-deploy runs
#       ↓
#   [Download JAR artifact] → [Place JAR in backend/build/libs/]
#       ↓
#   [Check CDK bootstrap] → [Bootstrap if needed]
#       ↓
#   [Deploy CDK Stack] → [Stack includes Lambda with JAR]
#       ↓
#   [Get Stack Outputs] → [Post stack info to PR]
#       ↓
#   [Call integration-tests.yml]
#
# CALLS OTHER WORKFLOWS:
#   - integration-tests.yml (workflow_call)
#     * Condition: Always after successful stack deployment
#     * Purpose: Run integration tests against the newly deployed stack
#     * Inputs: api_endpoint, stack_name, branch_name
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Stack name (format: StrideStack-{sanitized-branch-name})
#   - API Gateway endpoint URL
#   - Stack status
#   - Deployment timestamp
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - Must be called by: backend-build.yml (after successful build)
#   - Requires: JAR artifact from backend-build workflow
#   - Note: If triggered by CDK-only changes, will use latest JAR artifact
