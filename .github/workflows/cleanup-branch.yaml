# ============================================================================
# WORKFLOW: Cleanup Branch
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Destroys branch-specific CloudFormation stacks when a PR is merged.
#   This cleans up AWS resources (Lambda functions, API Gateway, etc.)
#   associated with feature branches after they've been merged into main.
#
# TRIGGERS:
#   1. Pull request closed and merged (pull_request: closed + merged):
#      - Automatically triggered when a PR is merged
#      - Extracts branch name from PR head ref
#      - Only destroys branch-specific stacks (not production StrideStack)
#   2. Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch):
#      - Can be run manually to cleanup any branch
#      - Inputs: branch_name
#
# WORKFLOW FLOW:
#   PR Merged OR Manual Trigger
#       ↓
#   cleanup-branch runs
#       ↓
#   [Extract/Validate branch name] → [Sanitize to stack name]
#       ↓
#   [Check if stack exists] → [Destroy CDK Stack]
#       ↓
#   [Verify cleanup] → [Post cleanup status]
#
# CALLS OTHER WORKFLOWS:
#   - None (cleanup workflow, no downstream dependencies)
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Cleanup status (success/failure)
#   - Stack name destroyed
#   - Cleanup timestamp
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - None (independent cleanup workflow)
#   - Note: Idempotent (safe to run multiple times, won't fail if stack doesn't exist)
