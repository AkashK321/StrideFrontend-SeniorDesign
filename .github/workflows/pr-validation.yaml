# ============================================================================
# WORKFLOW: PR Validation
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Fast CI validation for pull requests. Runs build and unit tests without any
#   deployment. This provides quick feedback on PRs without the overhead of
#   deploying to AWS.
#
# TRIGGERS:
#   1. Pull request events:
#      - Types: opened, synchronize, reopened
#      - Paths: aws_resources/**, .github/workflows/**
#      - Runs: Build + Unit Tests
#      - NO deployment (prevents duplicate branch stack deployments)
#
# WORKFLOW FLOW:
#   Pull Request Event (opened/updated)
#       ↓
#   pr-validation runs
#       ↓
#   [Build Kotlin JAR] → [Run Unit Tests]
#       ↓
#   [Fast CI complete - NO deployment]
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Build status (success/failure)
#   - Test results
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - None (standalone PR validation workflow)
