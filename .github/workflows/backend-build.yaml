# ============================================================================
# WORKFLOW: Backend Build
# ============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE:
#   Builds the Kotlin Lambda backend and runs unit tests. This is a pure
#   build/test workflow with no deployment logic. Outputs the JAR artifact
#   for use by the infrastructure deployment workflow.
#
# TRIGGERS:
#   1. Push event when backend code changes:
#      - Paths: aws_resources/backend/**
#      - Branches: All branches (**)
#   2. Pull request when backend code changes:
#      - Paths: aws_resources/backend/**
#      - Branches: All branches (**)
#   3. Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch):
#      - Can be run manually from GitHub Actions UI
#
# WORKFLOW FLOW:
#   Push Event (backend/** changed)
#       ↓
#   backend-build runs
#       ↓
#   [Build Kotlin JAR] → [Run Unit Tests]
#       ↓
#   [If tests pass] → [Upload JAR Artifact]
#       ↓
#   [Call infrastructure-deploy.yml] (ONLY if build and tests succeeded)
#
# CALLS OTHER WORKFLOWS:
#   - infrastructure-deploy.yml (workflow_call)
#     * Condition: ONLY if build succeeds AND unit tests pass
#     * Purpose: Gate infrastructure deployment behind successful builds/tests
#     * Inputs: branch_name, jar_artifact_id
#     * Note: Infrastructure deploy will handle both stack and Lambda deployment
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - JAR artifact (stored in workflow artifacts)
#     * Artifact name: kotlin-app-jar
#     * File: kotlin_app-1.0-all.jar
#   - Build status (success/failure)
#   - Test results
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - None (entry point workflow)
#   - Acts as gatekeeper for infrastructure deployment
