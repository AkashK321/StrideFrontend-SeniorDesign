/**
 * Landing screen - the first screen users see when opening the app.
 *
 * This is the root route ("/") for unauthenticated users. It displays a welcome message
 * and provides a "Sign in" button that navigates to the main tabbed app experience.
 *
 * Located in the (auth) route group, this screen serves as the entry point before users
 * authenticate. Future authentication flows (login, forgot password, etc.) will be added
 * alongside this screen in the (auth) directory.
