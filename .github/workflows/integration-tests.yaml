# WORKFLOW: Integration Tests
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Runs integration tests against a deployed CloudFormation stack.
#   Tests the full backend infrastructure including Lambda functions,
#   API Gateway endpoints, and any other AWS resources.
#
# TRIGGERS:
#   1. Called by infrastructure-deploy (workflow_call):
#      - Automatically triggered after successful stack deployment
#      - Receives: api_endpoint, stack_name, branch_name
#   2. Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch):
#      - Can be run manually with required inputs:
#        * api_endpoint: API Gateway endpoint URL
#        * stack_name: CloudFormation stack name
#        * branch_name: Branch name for context
#   3. Pull request label (optional):
#      - Can be triggered by adding a label like "run-tests" to PR
#
# WORKFLOW FLOW:
#   workflow_call OR workflow_dispatch
#       ↓
#   integration-tests runs
#       ↓
#   [Retrieve stack outputs] → [Run integration test suite]
#       ↓
#   [Generate test report] → [Post results to PR]
#       ↓
#   [Set status check] → [Exit with test results]
#
# CALLS OTHER WORKFLOWS:
#   - None (terminal workflow in pipeline)
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Test results (pass/fail)
#   - Test coverage report
#   - Test execution logs
#   - Status check for branch protection
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - Must be called by: infrastructure-deploy.yml (or manually)
#   - Requires: Deployed CloudFormation stack with API endpoint
